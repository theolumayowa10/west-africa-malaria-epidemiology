# West Africa Malaria Epidemiology Dashboard (2000–2021)

This project analyzes 21 years of malaria epidemiology data across West Africa using **Python** for data preparation and **Power BI** for interactive visualization. The goal is to uncover long-term trends, highlight high-burden countries, and support public health insights.

---

## Overview

The analysis focuses on:

- Malaria incidence trends (2000–2021)  
- 3-year rolling averages for smoothed patterns  
- Country-by-country malaria burden ranking  
- Geospatial distribution of malaria metrics  
- Interactive filtering by Year, Country, and Metric  

The final deliverable is a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** that allows users to explore malaria patterns across West Africa.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation (Python)
- Cleaned and standardized raw dataset  
- Calculated percentage changes and rankings  
- Generated rolling averages  
- Exported final CSV for Power BI  

### 2. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
- Connected cleaned dataset  
- Built interactive slicers  
- Created trend and rolling-average line charts  
- Added KPI and burden-ranking visuals  
- Designed map and pie chart for distribution analysis
